        <h2>Background + Overview</h2>
        <p>Lupii is a zero-waste and vegan cafe in Champlin Height comunity of Vancouver, BC.
          Lupii Cafe is all about sustainability. From vegan, zero-waste catering, to free produce,
          to education about what eating and living sustainably means, and building social
          connections to enable people to care about each other and the planet. (<u>https://lupiicafe.com/</u>)</p>
          <p>We want to look at how Lupii Cafe can influence/encourage more positive and mindful consumption habits - specifically waste.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Journey Touchpoint</h2>
        <p>The key takeaway from our persona research was the idea that awareness and education of the cafe’s values is already present to a certain extent. The real emphasis is following through on the information through changed behaviours.
          The journey framework allowed us to observe how Lupii Cafe interacts and communicates their values with their multifaceted community members. We realized that the key target audience audience would be regular community members who aren’t Lupii regulars. This is because there are increased opportunities for Lupii Cafe to educate and engage with community members not familiar with Lupii Cafe’s values.</p>

            <h2>Probe Insights</h2>
            <p>The most useful activity in our cultural probe was learning more about the consumption and waste habits of various community members as well as their food “priorities” chart. Similar to the persona, we realized the key emphasis is to reinforce and promote behaviours over information.

          <h2>Workshop Insights</h2>
          <p>We had four different workshops which are Customer Workshop, Behaviour Change Workshop, Active Change Workshop and Barriers Workshop.
            The key learnings from the workshops were the challenges and existing efforts to promote and change
            behaviours in the Champlain Heights Community. </p>

            <h2>Final Project</h2>
            <p>Our final product is Lupii Bin. These are the Lupii Bins, a public and interactive display piece designed to educate and encourage environmental sustainability and better habits surrounding waste and disposability. Designed by Lupii Cafe, these strategically placed bins educate users and measure the collective waste gathered each week in an effort to meet a weekly target. In reward for using the bins, users are able to select 1 of 4 potential rewards to help them get started or improve their environmentally-conscious habits.</p>
