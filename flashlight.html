        <h2>Background + Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Wristlight</strong> is a LED ﬂash light that is designed for kids around the age of
          6 and goes home alone when the sun is down. Kids are most of the time crazy when playing,
          a wearable ﬂashlight can prevent them from losing it, however imagine the running, falling,
          rolling during kids’ playtime, it’s hard to keep an item as exquisite as a ﬂashlight in good condition.
          <br><br>Therefore, a <strong>rugged and durable</strong> ﬂashlight is needed to stand-up to the “harsh” conditions
          it goes through. But it’s important to keep in mind that Wristlight is used as a wristband,
          so the surface is coated to prevent harm caused by rugged material to kids, and provide
          waterproof ability for cleaning.

      <h2>Persona + process</h2>
      <p>Our persona Mike is a 6-year-old boy who is very outgoing and loves
        role-play. He often acts superheroes and villains with his
        friends, fighting with each other in playground until the sun
        goes down. His parents worry that he might get hurt due to
        the rugged road on the way home, so they brought Mike a
        flash light to help him see the road even when it’s dark
        outside. Mike can wear the flashlight like a wristband, so he
        can play freely without worrying about losing the flashlight.

      <p>We wanted to make a flashlight that does not get lost easily, therefore we came up with
        the idea of a flashlight in the form of a wristband. At first, the flashlight is in a round
        shape, then we decide to open it so the light can be more directed and we adjusted the
        angle at the joint so the light shines forward.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>Wristlight’s <strong>LED lights</strong> are located at the joint
          surrounding a piece of small magnet, it turns on
          when the joint breaks by the twisting action
          causing the two magnets on both side of the
          joint to disconnect.
        </p>

        <p>The two magnets attached to each other will
          signal the lights to turn off, and breaking the
          loop will turn the lights on.</p>
          <p>User put Wristlight on by
            twisting the flashlight around
            the axis, that opens the
            flashlight so user can put his
            wrist in the <strong>concave</strong> then twist
            the flashlight back to its
            wristband form.</p>
            <p>When Wristligt is taken off
              from wrist, user can hold it in
              the middle, there are slots
              for <strong>better grip and thumb rest</strong>.
              The LED lights shines at an
              angle due to the angled cut at
              the joint, therefore when
              holding the flashlight upright,
              the light shines forward. </p>
